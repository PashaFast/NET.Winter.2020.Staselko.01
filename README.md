Task1
Given two integer signed four byte numbers and two bit positions i and j (i <= j).
Implement an algorithm for inserting the first (j - i + 1) bits of the second number into the first so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit i to bit j (the bits are numbered from right to left).

Task2
Implement a recursive function that determines whether a given four-byte integer is a palindrome.
